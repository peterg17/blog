    <div class="entry">
        <p>My recent projects have involved work between two OSes. I run Windows as my host OS and virtualize Ubuntu, and in order to share work efficiently between the two, I&#8217;ve been using a local bare Git repository in a shared folder.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s quite simple to set up:</p>

<p>First, make sure that you have a shared folder that is available to both your host and your guest OS. I personally use VirtualBox&#8217;s Guest Additions and its built-in Shared Folders functionality, so I mount my share using the following command, where &#8220;share&#8221; is the name of the shared folder I have defined in VirtualBox, and &#8220;~/host&#8221; is the path to which I am mounting:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo mount -t vboxsf share ~/host</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, initialize a bare Git repository in the shared folder:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cd "~/host"
</span><span class='line'>mkdir myrepo
</span><span class='line'>cd myrepo
</span><span class='line'>git init --bare</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Almost done. Return to your original repository and add to its remotes:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git remote add local "~/host/myrepo"
</span><span class='line'>git push local master</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, clone that repository from your other OS:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git clone "C:\vmshared\myrepo"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, you can <code>git push</code> and <code>git pull</code> between your repository on the host OS and your repository on the guest OS to synchronize changes.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/recovering-from-sugarsync-merge-failures-over-source-control-repositories">Recovering From SugarSync Merge Failures Over Source Control Repositories</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <h2>Intro to SugarSync (SS)</h2>

<p>Ever since I started using <strong><a href="http://sugarsync.com">SugarSync</a></strong>, I&#8217;ve loved the app. Until now, it&#8217;s proven to be easy to use and abnormally straightforward.</p>

<p>However, this weekend, SugarSync Manager decided to start crashing upon each load, making it completely unusable. I ordinarilly would have attempted to find and fix the cause of these crashes, but since the app was due for an update anyway, as I had neglected to run SugarSync (and sync latest changes) for a while, I decided to reinstall the Manager completely.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>That turned out to be a bad decision. For some reason, I wasn&#8217;t able to explain to SugarSync that the original device that had synced to my account is the same as the current device, so it treats them as different entities with the same device name. Instead, I decided to try SugarSync&#8217;s <em>merge</em> functionality - as the people at SS explain it, it looks for differences between the older (in this case) version synced and the newer (in this case) version available on the current device.</p>

<p>I did not expect this to be a problem, but SugarSync decided to start merging within the <code>.hg</code> and <code>.git</code> directories of my hg and git repositories. Thus, old dirstates and other key files were transformed to the version they had been at an earlier time.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>My folder structure looked someting like this for &#8220;infected&#8221; files:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>_Handwriting (from Maxim-laptop).i</code> // this is the newest one</li>
<li><code>_Handwriting.i</code> // this is the older one, but takes the place of the latest one.</li>
</ul>


<p>After countless bouts with HG in order to fix this via the HG tools, I decided to instead <strong><a href="https://github.com/maximz/sugarsyncfilefix">write a simple program</a></strong> that renames files in order to enable this to work.</p>

<p>File changes:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>_Handwriting.i</code> &#8211;> <code>_Handwriting.i.old</code></li>
<li><code>_Handwriting (from Maximlaptop).i</code> &#8211;> <code>_Handwriting.i</code></li>
</ol>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/facebook-timeline-niche">Facebook&#8217;s New Niche</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p><em>Note: This is a repost of <a href="http://blog.maximzaslavsky.com/2011/09/facebooks-new-niche/">a post</a> from my old blog. It was originally published on September 24, 2011.</em></p>

<p>In the midst of Facebook’s widly-discussed UI changes this week, one new feature fell through the cracks: the Timeline (currently only in developer beta, but you can be involved by <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/22/how-to-enable-facebook-timeline/">following these steps</a>).</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/w1or6.jpg" alt="Timeline" /></p>

<p>This new Timeline feature solves a major UI problem that Facebook has been plagued by – the disorganization of each user’s content. The previously-separate Wall, Info, Photos, and so on have all been combined into a single, centralized profile page. But the timeline goes beyond that. In displaying your entire Facebook activity over time, it also allows you to add “life events”, from achievements to medical events to anything, really.</p>

<p>By now, you’ve probably realized that these features don’t just show your entire Facebook activity – they’re meant to show your entire life.</p>

<p>(Note: Sure, this situation is interesting in terms of privacy, but let’s just assume that people will be willing to share the events of their lives. So far, they have been pretty willing.)</p>

<p>The main thing going for Facebook here is how much information they have. Besides sharing information, users give Facebook a ton of personal data. They’ve finally started using this data for more than just targeted advertising; for example, the timeline has a map page that tracks your activity, intersecting place information with status updates and more.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/oGjVZ.png" alt="Map" /></p>

<p><strong>Life-tracking might be Facebook’s niche.</strong> Google+’s focus is sharing, not identity creation. In terms of user identity, G+ certainly aims to consolidate your web activity under one profile. But Facebook doesn’t have the web – instead, they combine activity on their site (status updates, photos, places, and now app activity via Open Graph) with the life events you input. In a way, Google+ and Facebook aren’t currently competing in that realm, although Google might certainly try to follow Facebook. If anyone could do something like that best, it would be Google, specifically because of how much we rely on their services in our lives and how much information we have about ourselves on the web.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this timeline feature won’t be treated as just another annoying Facebook redesign. It has the potential to change the way we approach the Internet and collect our online identities. Facebook has been making dumb moves lately – but this might be <strong>their killer app</strong>.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/du-wikipedia">The Wikipedia Dilemna</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p><em>Originally published during my 7th grade year in </em>The Daily Urinal<em>, the &#8220;underground&#8221; newspaper of The Bishop&#8217;s School.</em></p>

<p>Try googling “Pompeii Vesuvius eruption,” or “Amyloidosis.” Can you guess what will be on the first page? That’s right: a Wikipedia article. If Wikipedia is so ubiquitous, why are our teachers restricting its uses for research?</p>

<p>This may have been a valid view almost 10 years ago, when Wikipedia started and was the Wild West of the Internet. Since then, things have changed: there are strict editorial guidelines and over 150,000 active registered users on the English Wikipedia alone, not even counting unregistered users, who make most of Wikipedia’s edits. Wikipedia has become good for research: the collective “brain” of a ton of people on the Internet is much greater than the brain of one expert writing an <em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em> article, for example.</p>

<p>Imagine that there is an error in <em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em>. When would it be corrected? In the next edition. On Wikipedia, such an error would typically be corrected in the next five minutes.</p>

<p>In denying that Wikipedia gives people an advantage in research, we&#8217;re assuming that this &#8220;collective brain&#8221; concept is bad. We mainly fear anonymous editing. While there is a lot of vandalism created through this practice, Wikipedia requires information to be properly cited and there are many <em>recent changes patrollers</em> checking sources and removing vandalism.</p>

<p>While direct citing of Wikipedia in research may be unacceptable, we should <strong>allow the use of it as a resource</strong>. Students should be allowed, and even encouraged, to read Wikipedia articles and <strong>follow the cited sources to find excellent research information</strong>. This way, we can still have the advantage that Wikipedia offers of countless brains over one brain, while avoiding the possibility of unnecessary vandalism and inaccurate information being presented.</p>

<p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/88008064/Writing/MZ_202.pdf">Here are two responses to my article that were published the following day. One is by the head librarian, the other is by an English faculty member.</a></p>

<p>For MSDN users who are confused about the N and KN versions of Windows that are available, since there is very little documentation about this, those are distributions specifically for Europe.</p>

<p>As I understand, the EU requires Microsoft to release such versions. They&#8217;re identical to standard versions with only one difference: in Windows 7, for example, those versions have no media players/apps from Microsoft pre-installed.</p>

<p><strong>No Windows Media Player. No Windows Media Center.</strong></p>

<p>But if you want these features in your N/KN install, you can download the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=19289">Windows Media Format Feature Pack</a>.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/using-netgear-as-ethernet-bridge">Dead-Simple Ethernet Bridge/Hub</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p><em>Note: This is a revamp of <a href="http://blog.maximzaslavsky.com/2009/12/using-a-netgear-wgt224-as-ethernet-bridge-hub/">a post</a> from my old blog. It was originally published on December 27, 2009.</em></p>

<p>Upon moving into my new office, I hit an instant dilemna: there was only one Ethernet port and I had multiple Ethernet devices.</p>

<p>Crisis.</p>

<p>As it turns out, it&#8217;s really easy to split an Ethernet connection. All you need is an old router to set up as a bridge. I used a Netgear WGT624:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LTCij.jpg" alt="Netgear WGT624 diagram" /></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Connect an Ethernet cable between the Ethernet port and the WAN port of your router.</p></li>
<li><p>Connect Ethernet cables between your network devices and LAN ports on the router.</p></li>
<li><p>On a connected device, browse to your router&#8217;s setup page; in my case, it was <code>192.168.1.1</code>. Login.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable DHCP on your router. On the WGT624, you go to &#8220;LAN IP Setup&#8221; under &#8220;Advanced&#8221; in the left navigation frame, then uncheck the checkbox marked &#8220;Use Router as DHCP Server&#8221; and click Apply.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide on whether you want the router to be a wireless hub, too, and enable/disable wireless accordingly. To configure this on the WGT624, click &#8220;Wireless Settings&#8221; under &#8220;Advanced&#8221; in the left navigation frame, then check or uncheck the checkbox marked &#8220;Enable Wireless Router Radio&#8221; and hit Apply.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the Ethernet cable inserted into the WAN port and insert into into another LAN port, instead.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>That did the trick for me. You might encounter a warning notice from your main router (not the bridge) when you first try this setup.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/csharp-cookies">C#: Handling Cookies in a Series of HttpWebRequest and HttpWebResponse Sessions</a></h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p><em>Note: This is a revamp of <a href="http://blog.maximzaslavsky.com/2009/06/c-handling-cookies-in-a-series-of-httpwebrequest-and-httpwebresponse-sessions/">a post</a> from my old blog.  It was originally published on June 28, 2009.</em></p>

<p>A while back, I was working on &#8220;wrapping&#8221; and extracting data from an online database UI. In order to retrieve data, a user would submit a series of HTML forms, view the resulting map, and then see a popup with a malformed-HTML table of all the points displayed on the map. My goal was to write some C# that would submit these painful forms in various desired combinations and retrieve and parse the points.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, a Fiddler run revealed that whoever wrote the UI decided to not just maintain session state, but also <em>transfer raw data</em> between the different UI pages using cookies and HTTP referrers with querystrings &#8230; naturally. :&#8217;(</p>

<p>Thankfully, C# makes this really easy to solve - you just create a cookie &#8220;jar&#8221; that carries over from HTTP session to another:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>var cookieJar = new CookieContainer(); // initialize cookieJar
</span><span class='line'>var request=(HttpWebRequest) WebRequest.Create("http://google.com"); // create your HttpWebRequests
</span><span class='line'>request.CookieContainer = cookieJar; // for each HttpWebRequest you make, add cookieJar</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Use the last line to apply <code>cookieJar</code> to each request and you&#8217;re set!</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <p><em>Note: This is a revamp of <a href="http://blog.maximzaslavsky.com/2009/06/adding-a-favicon-to-your-wordpress-com-blog/">a post</a> from my old blog. It was originally published on June 1, 2009.</em></p>

<p>The documentation for adding favicons to <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> blogs is a bit confusing. The right way to do it is to create a <strong>Blavatar</strong>: Blog + Avatar.</p>

<p>A Blavatar is an uploaded picture that functions as your avatar when you comment on other blogs or when they link to your blog, and as your favicon.</p>

<p>To get started, open the Settings &#8211;> General page of a Wordpress.com blog dashboard. Upload a jpg or png to the &#8220;Blog Picture&#8221; panel, and then Wordpress.com will help you crop it to for it to be a valid favicon.</p>

<p>I recommend uploading a large, square Blavatar that Wordpress will then scale down to the proper favicon size, so that other Blavatar usage is at a good resolution.</p>

<p><em>This applies only to Wordpress.com blogs. For self-hosted <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress.org</a> installations, you can either use one of the many available favicon plugins, or you can manually create and upload a favicon to your root directory.</em></p>

## Russian Writers class

Here are several of the essays I wrote in the _Russian Writers_ course I took during my last year of high school.

We covered a few seminal works of Russian literature in this clsas. The essays below are the products of research and discussion about two such pieces: _Crime and Punishment_ and _One Day In The Life of Ivan Denisovitch_.

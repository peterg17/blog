I was accidentally featured on the local nightly news on 05/31/13. A journalist called me up that morning to confirm the story, then arranged a 15-minute interview for the evening.

Here is the article the news bureau released the news morning: [http://www.10news.com/news/teen-prodigy-headed-to-princeton-university-unable-to-walk-at-high-school-commencement06012013](http://www.10news.com/news/teen-prodigy-headed-to-princeton-university-unable-to-walk-at-high-school-commencement06012013)

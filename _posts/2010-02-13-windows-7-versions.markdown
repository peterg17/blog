*Note: This is a revamp of [a post](http://blog.maximzaslavsky.com/2010/02/windows-7-n-and-kn-versions/) from my old blog.  It was originally published on February 13, 2010.*

For MSDN users who are confused about the N and KN versions of Windows that are available, since there is very little documentation about this, those are distributions specifically for Europe.

As I understand, the EU requires Microsoft to release such versions. They're identical to standard versions with only one difference: in Windows 7, for example, those versions have no media players/apps from Microsoft pre-installed.

**No Windows Media Player. No Windows Media Center.**

But if you want these features in your N/KN install, you can download the [Windows Media Format Feature Pack](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=19289).
